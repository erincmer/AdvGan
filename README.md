TODO: 

Get generator with the control of the loop

- Specify the format of:
  * the input of the generator G1/G2 (word index, one hot)
  * the output of the generator G1/G2(word index, one hot, distro)
  * the input to the disc D1/D2(word index, one hot)
 
- Is the code of D3 different than D1/D2 ? In the end, all of them receive a
  dialogue and must say whether it is human or not

- How to update the generator used by the rollout ?
